# Face-Mask-Detection

This is a model developed to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
It can be quite helpful in the public places like hospitals,offices,general stores and many more...

As the country starts going through various stages of reopening, covering our faces with a mask has become a new normal amidst the pandemic, as face masks are effective in preventing the virus outbreak. 
Face masks have become an important element of our daily lives and are here to stay. Wearing face masks will be required in order to socialize or conduct business.
So we need a system that detects whether a person is wearing mask or not.

  
It can be connected with any surveillance system installed at your premise.
The authorities or admin can check the person through the system to confirm their identity
The accuracy rate of detecting a person with a face mask is 90-95% depending on the digital capabilities

The main technologies used in this project includes Python and Machine learning using Keras and Tensorflow.
And many Python libraries/Dependencies are used in projects
Software used  is Google colab (You can use what you wish for but download all the required dependencies first(have a look in the file itself)
